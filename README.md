    <h2>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h2>
	<p>My journey in tech began in 2016 when I joined first year in the Technical University of Kenya(TUK). I was joining campus to study
        Applied Statistics. To my advantage, my course required that I study at least one computer unit per semester, that is in addition to the several other units I studied.
        From the first day, I was super excited to attend my computer lessons. However, the challenge was that I did'nt own a PC. I would borrow from friends and 
        sometimes my brother who was a student in the University of Nairobi(UON). By the time I was in third year, work got more intensive and I always wished I could practise 
        my computer programming and data analysis skills as taught in class but then I did'nt own a PC. By then my friends got busier with class work and projects and 
        my brother was done with schooling at the UON. So I only focused on getting good grades in my exams but I kept feeling left out in technology. 
        All in all, I graduated with a Degree in B.Tech(Applied Statistics), upper second class honors in July 2021.

    <P>On May 2024, I was lucky to be interviewed and picked to join the AWS Re/start program by Amazon Web Services in conjuction with emobiis technology.
        The 12 weeks program was super intensive with a practical experience to cloud computing and its concepts.
        It ended with an exam which led to my certification as an AWS certified cloud practitioner.</P>
